Hippolyta

Hippolyta is a web application inspired by Amazon.com.
Users(sellers) can put products up for sale on Hippolyta, and other users(buyers)
can search for those products, add them to their carts, and then mock purchase them.

To implement this application, I used:

* Ruby on Rails

* PostgreSQL

* JavaScript, jQuery, and Backbone.js

* HTML5

* CSS

and various Ruby gems, such as:

* pg_search

* Kaminari

* Paperclip

* Figaro

* JBuilder

* EJS

* BCrypt

* Stripe

The credit card form in the checkout view only accepts test information,
uses Stripe to store a token to the database, and does not record any sensitive
data.

Try out the app [here](http://hippolyta.us).  Sign in as a test user, to view
the features, or make your own account and play around.
